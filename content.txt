About Us:
The Canadian Space Ethics Research and Policy Institute (CSERPI) serves as a multidisciplinary platform focused on addressing ethics and policy issues related to current human activities in outer space and resource utilization. The key functions and activities which CSERPI undertake include but are not limited to: Education and Outreach, Policy Analysis and Advocacy, Research, Collaboration and Networking, Publications and Information Dissemination.
By fulfilling these roles, CSERPI contributes to the responsible and ethical advancement of outer space activities, ensuring that the benefits of space exploration are distributed equitably and that potential harms are mitigated.
Education and Outreach
Public Awareness and Educational Programs: 
Promotes greater public awareness, educational programs and understanding of the ethical and policy implications associated with human activities in outer space by organizing inclusive workshops, interactive seminars, and public lectures. 

These public awareness and educational events address critical topics such as the responsible use of outer space, the management of space debris, equitable access to space resources, the protection of planetary environments and intergenerational justice across all species. 

By providing accessible platforms for learning and discussion, these initiatives can engage diverse audiences, foster ethical and policy reflection, and encourage informed participation in shaping the future of space exploration and governance.

Creates accessible and engaging educational programs, trainings, professional development courses and informational materials designed to help the public better understand current developments in space exploration, technology, and the ethical issues that arise from humanity’s expanding presence in outer space. 

 Encourages responsible citizenship by explaining complex topics such as space debris control measures, planetary contamination risks, and the fair use of space resources in clear and relatable terms. 

By fostering greater public awareness, educational trainings and understanding, these programs can empower individuals and communities to participate in conversations about the future of space activities and their impact on society and the environment. 

Diversity: 
Promotes and advances equity, diversity, and inclusion (EDI) within the Canadian space sector by developing and advocating for policies, programs, and initiatives that ensure equitable access to opportunities for underrepresented groups. 

This includes fostering an inclusive environment that values diverse perspectives, backgrounds, and experiences in areas such as space science, engineering, policy, and leadership. 


By prioritizing EDI, the Canadian space sector can strengthen innovation, enhance collaboration, and reflect the full diversity of Canadian society in shaping the future of space exploration and development.
